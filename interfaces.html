<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>
<p>Interfaces let you focus on what you want your code rather than how it does it.</p>
<h2 id="why-care-about-interfaces">Why care about interfaces?</h2>
<p>Interfaces seem very abstract and unnecessary at first. They are, however, a very useful way to make your code more flexible and maintainable. (Buzzword counter: 2.)</p>
<p>Don't go looking for situations where you can use interfaces. If you use an interface in every single situation where you can, you will make your project more complicated for no reason.</p>
<p>You will end up working with interfaces a lot in .NET, if only due to LINQ. Understanding what an interface is will make the age-old question 'what is the difference between <code>IEnumerable&lt;&gt;</code> and <code>List&lt;&gt;</code>?' a lot easier to understand.</p>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>Interfaces are a solution to a problem. Imagine a program that lets people register user-accounts and edit their details. You might have a method that looks like this.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>public void ChangeUsername(int userID, string newName)
{
    var user = UserDetailsDatabaseLoader.Load(id);
    user.Name = newName;
}
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>...</p>
<p>You then learn that you will also have to load user details from the filesystem, and not just a database.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>public void ChangeUsername(int userID, string newName)
{
    var user = UserDetailsFilesystemLoader.Load(id);
    user.Name = newName;
}
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>Constantly going back and changing this code every time we decide on a different way to store user information is pretty annoying.</p>
<p>This method really shouldn't care about how it gets a user's information -- all it cares about is if it has the user or not.</p>
<p>Using an interface lets us express the 'idea' of something which gives us user details without specifying how it does it.</p>
