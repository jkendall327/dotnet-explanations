= Simple explanations for .NET concepts

This site is a place for me to record my understanding of .NET, C# and related technologies. My hope is that it will also serve as a useful learning resources for anyone who was in the same position as me -- interested in .NET as a general concept but confused by unfamiliar names, project types and terminology.

My goal is to give you the 'eureka moment' needed to appreciate more detailed resources, like the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/[MSDN] or a https://www.manning.com/[Manning Press] book. I try to write as directly and clearly as possible. If you read a page and think 'well, that's pretty simple, why did he feel the need to explain that?' -- I'm happy.

This page isn't a programming tutorial, so I won't explain fundamental concepts like variables or for-loops.
