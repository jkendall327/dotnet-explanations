<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>
<p>Properties are a kind of method that make the <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> keywords more powerful.</p>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>One of the hardest parts of programming is organising your code in a sensible way. While it's very possible to make useful applications in a single long file of code (<a href="https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/">here's an example</a>, this quickly becomes hard to work with for big projects.</p>
<p>An important part of object-oriented programming is that a class can choose to hide some of its internal operations from the outside world.</p>
<p>This is what you are doing when you use the <code>public</code> or <code>private</code> keyword in C#. If a class has a <code>public</code> field, any other part of the program can read that data, or edit it. If the field is <code>private</code>, only the class itself can see it.</p>
<p>(Advanced note: there are several other visibility modifiers in C#, like <code>internal</code> and <code>protected</code>. They all just extend the basic idea of public/private.)</p>
<p>Marking a field as public or private is good, but it's also limiting. If another part of the program can read a <code>public</code> field, it can also set it to a nonsense value. This is a common source of bugs.</p>
<p>We want, then, a way to separate the ability to read a piece of information from the ability to edit it. A sensible way to do this is with methods.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>public class MyClass
{
    private string importantInformation;

    public string GetImportantInformation
    {
        return importantInformation;
    }
}
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>Other parts of the program can now see what <code>importantInformation</code> is, but they can't edit it. Only <code>MyClass</code> can.</p>
<p>We can also use methods to control how other parts of the program edit a field.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>public class MyClass
{
    private string importantInformation;

    public void SetImportantInformation(string newInformation)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(newInformation))
        {
            return;
        }
        else
        {
            importantInformation = newInformation;
        }
    }
}
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>Other parts of the program can now edit <code>importantInformation</code>, but they have to go through this new method first. The method stops nonsense values like a <code>null</code> string getting passed in. We can now be a lot more confident that <code>importantInformation</code> will always be a sensible value.</p>
<p>You now understand the idea behind properties in C#. Everything else is just convenient syntax for doing these kinds of things in a simpler way.</p>
<h2 id="convenient-syntax">Convenient syntax</h2>
<p>Consider the following snippet of code.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>public string ImportantInformation { get; private set; }
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>To other parts of the program, <code>ImportantInformation</code> will behave like any other string. They can get its value without any issues. But they won't be able to edit it in any way. In a single line of code, we've made a field that other parts of the program can read but not modify.</p>
<p>The <code>{ get; private set; }</code> syntax is very convenient, but there is another form we can use. This snippet of code is identical:</p>
<p>// ...</p>
<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>There is nothing magical at all about the <code>{ get; private set; }</code> syntax. When the C# compiler reads this, it simply creates two methods in your class that return and set the value of the field.</p>
