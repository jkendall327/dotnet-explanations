## In a nutshell
The different ways you can use it to make websites is one of the most confusing parts of .NET. Here are some terms you will hear:
* Webforms, an outdated project type popular several years ago
* ASP.NET, a very popular project type still in use today
* ASP.NET Core, an updated version of ASP.NET that aligns with [.NET Core](dotnet-versions.md)
* Razor, a part of ASP.NET Core that lets you build user interfaces
* Blazor, another part of ASP.NET Core that lets you build user interfaces
* SignalR, a part of ASP.NET Core made for real-time web apps

## What should I learn?
You should probably start off by learning ASP.NET Core.
