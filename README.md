This is a simple static site I'm developing to calcify my knowledge of .NET and hopefully provide a useful learning resource for newcomers to the platform.

My aim is to provide simple, buzzword-free explanations that give you the 'aha!' moment needed to start serious study of a topic. In other words, I'm making the kind of site I wish I'd had when I was just starting with .NET.

I won't be giving overly technical descriptions of concepts but will link to resources which do when appropriate.
