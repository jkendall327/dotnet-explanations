# dotnet-explanations

This is a simple static site I'm developing to calcify my knwoledge of .NET and hopefully provide a useful learning resource for newcomers to the platform.

My aim is to focus on simple, buzzword-free explanations that give you the 'aha!' moment needed to start serious study of a topic. To that end, I won't be giving overly technical descriptions of concepts but will try to link to resources which do when appropriate.

In other words, I'm making the kind of site I wish I'd had when I was just starting with .NET.
