<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>
<p>When you run a .NET program, it's like booting up a very small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">virtual machine</a> made just for running your code.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-this-solves">The problem this solves</h2>
<p>The reason .NET works this way - by running your code in a small virtual machine - is because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java works this way</a>. .NET was originally Microsoft's attempt to do Java, but better.</p>
<p>The main reason Java used a virtual machine is for portability.</p>
<p>Different computers have different <em>architectures</em>, meaning their processors work with different sets of instructions.</p>
<p>If you want a program to run on different architectures, you need a compiler that 'targets' them. Targeting seven architectures means writing seven separate compilers, which is obviously not ideal.</p>
<p>Java responded to this by abstracting the machine your code runs on. Rather than running on any specific architecture, your code compiles to an imaginary architecture. This is usually called <em>bytecode</em>.</p>
<p>When a new kind of architecture comes out, you can now support it by just porting over the virtual machine. Existing code will work on new platforms 'for free'.</p>
<p>In simpler terms:</p>
<ol>
<li>You write a program.</li>
<li>Your code is compiled to an 'intermediate' language.</li>
<li>When a user opens the program, the virtual machine turns the intermediate code into real instructions the computer understands.</li>
</ol>
<p>.NET works in a very similar way.</p>
<h2 id="the-common-language-runtime">The Common Language Runtime</h2>
<p>The Common Language Runtime, also informally called the '.NET runtime', is the virtual machine your C# code targets. Its language is the Common Intermediate Language (CIL), also called MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) or just 'IL' for short.</p>
<p>Another advantage to using an intermediate language is that multiple languages can compile down to it. In .NET, for instance, C# and F# both compile to CIL. You can think of both languages as 'really' just versions of CIL that are easier to use. You can write CIL directly, if you want.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit">The JIT</h2>
<p>The Just-in-Time compiler turns CIL into real machine instructions when you run a .NET program.</p>
